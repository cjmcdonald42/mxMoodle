## Subpackage Description
The Healthpass subplugin allows users to enter their health information on a form. Those with specific capabilites can then see this health information on a report which includes buttons to allow/deny each user from attending class and notify these users accordingly.

## Email Notifications
The Healthpass subplugin includes several email notifications triggered by different events.
They are as follows:
- The Healthcenter Notification is sent only to the email specified in Healthpass preferences when a user's healthform is denied.
- The Healthpass Approved Notification is sent to a user if his or her healthform is approved.
- The Healthpass Denied Notification is sent to a user if his or her healthform is denied.
- The Healthpass Overridden Notification is sent to a user if his or her healthform status is overridden on the Healthpass report.
- The Healthpass Reminder Notification is sent to all users who have not completed a healthpass in a specified number (configurable in preferences) of days. This notification can be triggered with a button on the Healthpass report.
