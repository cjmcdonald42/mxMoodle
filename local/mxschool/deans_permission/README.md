## Subpackage Description
The Deans' Permissions subplugin allows students to request permission to attend off campus events via a Moodle form. Faculty are able to review these requests in a report in which they can request additional review from other faculty members before approving the student's request.

## Email Notifications
The Deans' Permissions subplugin includes several email notifications triggered by different events.
They are as follows:
- The Deans' Permission Form Submitted Notification goes to the email address specified in Deans' Permission preferences when a Deans' Permission for is submitted.
- The Sports Review Request Notification goes to the email address specified in Deans' Permission preferences when the 'Request Review' button is clicked in the 'Miss Sports' column of the report.
- The Class Review Request Notification goes to the email address specified in Deans' Permission preferences when the 'Request Review' button is clicked in the 'Miss Class' column of the report.
- The Deans' Permission Form Approved Notification goes to the student who submitted the form, that student's advisor, and, if the student is missing study hours to attend the event, that student's head of house. The email is sent if the form is approved on the report.
