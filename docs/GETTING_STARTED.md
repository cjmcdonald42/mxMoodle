# Getting Started with Moodle Programming

This work is a combination of talents and technologies - Coding, UX, Documenting, QA, etc. No matter how you contribute, the more open you are to working with the many pieces that make up this complex project, the greater your impact will be.

1. Learn about the [Web Technologies](/docs/TECHNOLOGIES.md) used by this project.
2. Download the tools for [Your Developer Environment](/docs/TOOLS.md).
3. Prepare your own [Development Server](/docs/SERVER.md).
4. Check out our [open issues](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/issues) and [project boards](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/projects).

If you've made it this far, you are ready to join us. </br>
If you have questions or at any time are unsure what to do next, please ask. </br>
*All questions, insights, and feedback are welcome.*
