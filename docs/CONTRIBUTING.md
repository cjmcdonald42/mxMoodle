# Contributing to this repository
I'm really glad you're reading this.

The [Moodle Development Team](/docs/ABOUT_US.md) is a student-led initiative that has made a profound impact on the Middlesex community and it needs you - your passion, your talent, and your creativity - to continue.

## Getting Started
1. Send [Chuck](mailto:cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu) an email expressing your interest and include your GitHub profile name or link.
2. Read our [Code of Conduct](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
3. Read our [getting started guide](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
4. Our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/issues) and [project boards](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/projects/4) show our work in progress and are a good starting point for jumping in.

This work is a combination of talents and technologies - Coding, UX, Documenting, QA, etc. There are many ways to be involved and our mxMoodle plugin suite will be better because of you.

## Submitting Changes
All commits are made in feature branches specifically named for the issue being addressed. Commits are save points reflecting significant changes. Pull requests are made to the dev branch containing individual features ready for inclusion. When the dev branch is ready to take its place as the next live version of our code, it is squashed and merged with the main branch by the repository administrators.

## Coding conventions
Start by reading our code. We optimize for readability and you'll quickly get the hang of it. Read and refer to Moodle's own [coding style page](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle). This document contains important information about how you should structure and format your PHP code.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

All questions, insights, and feedback are welcome.
