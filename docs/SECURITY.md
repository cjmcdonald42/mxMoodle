# Security Policy
Only the most recent version of this code is maintained and supported. Our production server runs Moodle 3.11 with mxMoodle v3.4. Moodle does not track or store any personal or sensitive information. 

## Reporting security problems
**Do not create an issue to report a security problem.**
Instead, please send an email to directly to Chuck at:  \<cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu\>

Chuck is the Academic Technology Specialist and responds to security incident reports as fast as possible; within one business day at the latest. If Chuck does not respond within a reasonable time, please resend the incident report to the mxHelpDesk at: \<helpme@mxschool.edu\>

## Incident Response Process
In case an incident is discovered or reported, We will follow the following process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment
* Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
* Is the incident outside of our influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
* Find out who knows about the incident and who is affected.
* Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response
After the initial assessment and containment to the best of our ability, We will document all actions taken in a response plan. \
We will create a comment in the official "Updates" issue to inform users about the incident and what actions we took to contain it.

### 3. Remediation
Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, we will summarize the lessons learned from the incident and create a list of actions we will take to prevent it from happening again.
