# MX Moodle Code of Conduct
Much like the Middlesex Community, the Moodle Development Team is comprised of hardworking individuals with different backgrounds and expertise. We strive towards accessibility, acceptance, and cooperation. However, these values may cause issues in communication, perspective, and understanding. As a solution, we have created a set of rules and kindly ask all team members to adhere to these rules when working on or with this project. This code applies to the founders, programmers, and users.

In addition, all Middlesex students pledge to uphold the principles and high ideals laid out in the Student Handbook. This Code of Conduct seeks to build on the Student Handbook and defers to it.

## Our Standards
- **Be Welcoming.** The Moodle Development Team works hard to accept all individuals with different backgrounds and identities. This includes race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability. 
- **Be Positive and Nurturing.** Everyone within the Moodle Development Team has different skillsets and perspectives. There is no need for condescension or superiority. As a community, we should strive to help others when necessary and learn from others when we find things we don't understand. 
- **Be Respectful to Others.** Despite our differences in beliefs and opinions, these are not excuses for bad behavior and manners. We should strive to always be respectful of others while working together.
- **Be Open to Other's Ideas.** Instead of immediately rejecting others' ideas, we must strive to understand others' perspectives in order to discover multiple solutions to problems. This openness allows for smooth communication and kinder working environments.
- **Be Careful of What You Say.** We must conduct ourselves in a kind and respectful manner. Harassment or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Types of harassment include:
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Sexual and Violent Posts.
  - Doxxing.
  - Personal insults.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Encouraging bad behavior and manners.
  - Repeated harassment of others.
