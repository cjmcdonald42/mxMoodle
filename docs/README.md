## Documentation
Unfortunately, in its current state, the documentation for this project doesn't cover everything there is to know; however between [our documentation](/docs), [Moodle's documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Main_Page), and the abundant examples provided by the existing code, you should be able to get a sense of how things are working.

This is the status of the documentation we currently have in place beyond the getting started page:
