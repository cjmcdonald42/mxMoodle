## Contributing
This project offers a context for students to apply computer science skills to benefit the Middlesex community. For information on how to get started working on Moodle plugins for this project see the [getting started guide](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Documentation
The documentation for this project doesn't cover everything there is to know, but between [our documentation](/docs), [Moodle's documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Main_Page), and the abundant examples provided by the existing code, you should be able to get a good sense of how things are working.

These are the documentation pages that we currently have in place:
- [Middlesex Moodle Plugins Coding Style](/docs/CODING_STYLE.md)
- [Steps for Creating a New Local Plugin](/docs/CREATING_A_NEW_PLUGIN.md)
- [Middlesex Moodle Local Plugin Structure](/docs/PLUGIN_STRUCTURE.md)
- [Middlesex Moodle General File Structure](/docs/GENERAL_FILE_STRUCTURE.md)
- [Middlesex Moodle API Layer](/docs/API_LAYER.md)

If you have time to read through all of the pages, it would make the most sense to read them in the order they are listed.
