## The Moodle Development Team
The Moodle Development Team is a student-driven club of coders and creatives responsible for this project and its future at Middlesex School. Students lead this project through all phases of development, coding, UX design, quality assurance, and documentation.

**And we need you.** \

Moodle is the world's most popular learning management system powering [hundreds of thousands of learning environments worldwide](https://stats.moodle.org). Moodle is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and aligned with the United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). To develop for Moodle is to invest in the future and become a citizen of the world. Learn more at: \<[http://moodle.org](https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/About_Moodle)\>.

## History of this project
### v1.0
This project began in the mid 2000's as a locally hosted website alongside our newly built Moodle Server running early versions of Moodle v2. Dr. Michael Schaeberle and Ryan Laughlin, Class of 2007, designed and built the first version of this code as a stand-alone website using php and javascript. The system was accessed via links on dorm Moodle pages. It provided the check-in sheets for dorm heads and grew to include Advisor Selection, Rooming, and Vacation Travel functionality.

Following Ryan's graduation, Dr. Schaeberle brought in [Rob Barnett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-barnett-81b7638/) and The Learning Curve Consortium, Inc to handle programming, security, training, and move the site to an external host. With Mr. Barnett, Dr Schaeberle developed the first version of the eSignout system and Peer Tutoring functionality.

### v2.0
Following the successful transition to Moodle v3, Dr. Schaeberle passed the torch to [Charles J McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, in 2012-2013. In 2015, we moved our Moodle Server hosting to an official Moodle Partner, [Moonami](https://www.moonami.com) and, with their help, rewrote our code as a set of Moodle plugins.

### v3.0 and 3.1
In 2018-2019, [Jeremiah DrGreeff](https://github.com/jrdegreeff), Class of 2019, and [Charles J McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, began a ground-up rewrite of our Moodle plugins, developing an API layer and documentation that would facilitate all future work and make Moodle programming even more accessible to our students. This fresh code base expanded our signout system to include both on and off campus signouts, and introduce interactive elements such as the Proctors' Event Check-In list.

### v3.2 and 3.3
In 2020-2021, [Cannon Caspar](https://github.com/Cannon544), Class of 2021, took lead of the Moodle Development Team. With [Charles J McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, he enhanced and updated many systems in our mxMoodle code; adding the new Healthpass and Healthtest subsystems, and creating the Deans' Permission Form. Over the summer of 2021, Cannon passed the reins to [Aarav Mehta](https://github.com/AaravMehta4897), Class of 2023, to further enhance the healthtest system with a new audit report.

### v3.4
Over the spring and summer of 2022, the mxMoodle Development Team, led by [Aarav Mehta](https://github.com/AaravMehta4897) and advised by [Charles J McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, enhanced the functionality of the Deans' Permission and the Peer Tutoring System and expanded the documentation to bring it in line with global standards for open source projects.
