# About us

## History of this project
### v1.0
This project began in the mid 2000's as a locally hosted website alongside our newly built Moodle Server running early versions of Moodle 2. Dr. Michael Schaeberle and Ryan Laughlin, Class of 2007, designed and built the first version of this code using php and javascript. The system provided the check-in sheets for dorm heads and grew to include Advisor Selection, Rooming, and Vacation Travel functionality.

Following Ryan's graduation, Dr. Schaeberle brought in [Rob Barnett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-barnett-81b7638/) and The Learning Curve Consortium, Inc to handle programming, security, training, and move the site to an external host. With Mr. Barnett, Dr Schaeberle developed the first version of the eSignout system and Peer Tutoring functionality.

### v2.0
Following the successful transition to Moodle 3, Dr. Schaeberle handed this project over to [Chuck McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, in 2012-2013. In 2015, we moved our Moodle Server hosting to an official Moodle Partner, [Moonami](https://www.moonami.com) and, with their help, rewrote our code as a set of Moodle plugins.

### v3.0 and 3.1
In 2018-2019, [Jeremiah DrGreeff](https://github.com/jrdegreeff), Class of 2019, and [Chuck McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, began a ground-up rewrite of our Moodle plugins, developing an API layer and documentation that would facilitate all future work and make Moodle programming even more accessible to our students. This fresh code base expanded our signout system to include both on and off campus signouts, and introduce interactive elements such as the Proctors' Event Check-In list.

### v3.2 and 3.3
In 2020-2021, [Cannon Caspar](https://github.com/Cannon544), Class of 2021, took the lead of the Moodle Development Team. With [Chuck McDonald](https://github.com/MXchuck), Academic Technology Specialist, he enhanced and updated many systems in our mxMoodle code; adding the new Healthpass and Healthtest subsystems, and creating the Deans' Permission Form.
