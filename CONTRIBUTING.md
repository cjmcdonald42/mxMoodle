# Contributing to this repository
I'm really glad you're reading this.

The Moodle Development Team is a student-led initiative that has made a profound impact on the Middlesex community and it needs your passion, your talent, and your creativity to continue.

To get started:
1. Send [Chuck](mailto:cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu) an email expressing your interest and include your GitHub profile name or link.
2. Read our Code of Conduct.
3. Read or review our [getting started guide](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
4. Our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/issues) and [project boards](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/projects) show our work in progress and are a good starting point for jumping in.

This work is a combination of talents and technologies - Coding, UX, Documenting, QA, etc. There are many ways to be involved and our mxMoodle plugin will be better because you are involved.

All commits are made to the dev branch in sub-branches specifically named for the issue being addressed. Pull requests are made to the dev branch before finally being squashed and merged to the main branch by the repository administrators. If you do your development work in a fork of this repository, that pull request should merge into dev/issue for review by the team before merging into the dev branch.
