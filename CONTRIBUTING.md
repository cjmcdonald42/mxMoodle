# Contributing to this repository
I'm really glad you're reading this.

The Moodle Development Team is a student-led initiative that has made a profound impact on the Middlesex community and it needs your passion, your talent, and your creativity to continue.

## Getting Started
1. Send [Chuck](mailto:cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu) an email expressing your interest and include your GitHub profile name or link.
2. Read our Code of Conduct.
3. Read or review our [getting started guide](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
4. Our [issue tracker](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/issues) and [project boards](https://github.com/mxschool/mxMoodle/projects) show our work in progress and are a good starting point for jumping in.

If you are not a Middlesex student, please do steps 1 and 2.
Then contact [Chuck](mailto:cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu) for further instructions.

This work is a combination of talents and technologies - Coding, UX, Documenting, QA, etc. There are many ways to be involved and our mxMoodle plugin will be better because you are involved.

## Submitting Changes
All commits are made to the dev branch in sub-branches specifically named for the issue being addressed. Commits are save points reflecting significant changes. Pull requests made to the dev branch contain individual features ready for inclusion.  
When the dev branch is ready to take its place as the next live version of our code, it is squashed and merged with the main branch by the repository administrators.

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability.

* Indent using a soft tab of 4 spaces
* Use double slash for single line comments and use \/* *\/ for multi-line comment blocks.

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
