# MX Moodle Code of Conduct

Much like the Middlesex Community, the Moodle Development Team is comprised of hardworking individuals with different backgrounds and expertise. We ensure that we strive towards accessibility, acceptance, and cooperation.

Inclusion and particpation are the main aspects of which the Moodle Development Team strives to uphold; however, these values may cause issues in communcation, perspective, and understanding. As a solution, we have created a set of rules that we kindly ask all to adhere. This code applies to the founders, programmers, and users.

This code applies to all spaces managed by the Moodle Development Team. These spaces include: Moodle, Github, and Moodle In-House Server Development. If the rules have been violated within or outside these spaces, the ability to participate may be revoked from these individuals. 

If you believe there is any infractions or violations of the code of conduct, we ask that you immediately report it by emailing <cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu>.

## Rules

- **Be Welcoming.** The Moodle Development Team works hard to accept all individuals with different backgrounds and identities. This includes race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability. 
- **Be Positive and Nurturing.** Everyone within the Moodle Development Team has different skillsets and perspectives. There is no need for condescension or superiority. As a community, we should strive to help others when necessary and learn from others when we find things we don't understand. 
- **Be Respectful to Others.** Despite our differences in beliefs and opinions, these are not excuses for bad behavior and manners. We should strive to always be respectful of others while working together.
- **Be Open to Other's Ideas.** Instead of immediately rejecting others' ideas, we must strive to understand others' perspectives in order to discover multiple solutions to problems. This openness allows for smooth communcation and kinder working environments.
- **Be Careful of What You Say.** We must conduct ourselves in a kind and respectful manner. Harrassment or personal attacks will not be tolerated. Types of harassment include:
      - Violent threats or language.
      - Discriminatory jokes and language.
      - Sexual and Violent Posts.
      - Doxxing.
      - Personal insults.
      - Unwelcome sexual attention.
      - encouraging bad behavior and manners.
      - Repeated harassment of others.
