## Reporting security problems
**Do not create an issue to report a security problem.**
Instead, please send an email to directly to Chuck at:  \<cjmcdonald@mxschool.edu\>

Chuck is the Academic Technology Specialist and responds to security incident reports as fast as possible, within one business day at the latest. If Chuck does not respond within a reasonable time, please resend the incident report to the mxHelpDesk at: \<helpme@mxschool.edu\>

## Incident Response Process
In case an incident is discovered or reported, I will follow the following process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment
* Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
* Is the incident outside of my influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
* Find out who knows about the incident and who is affected.
* Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response
After the initial assessment and containment to my best abilities, I will document all actions taken in a response plan.

I will create a comment in the official "Updates" issue to inform users about the incident and what I actions I took to contain it.

### 3. Remediation
Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, I will summarize the lessons learned from the incident and create a list of actions I will take to prevent it from happening again.
